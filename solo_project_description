Michael Lee Solo Project

My solo project will be a platform where users can work on their own projects or hobbies side-by-side to keep themselves accountable, or to collaborate on projects together. I think it will turn out looking similar to Discord with a narrow focus/mission. Ideally it would utilize video-chatting (perhaps via Zoom or some other third party host) and would only take care of arranging people with similar interests/availabilities and the scheduling/ushering of virtual hangouts. Due to time constraints, I'll create a text chat room in lieu of video-conferencing.

The project will be a MERN stack, and will feature:

- User registration/login with validations
- A dashboard displaying users looking for hangouts (whether now or at a scheduled time)
- CRUD functionality for user posts
- one-to-many relationship between user and posts



In the product backlog (features I think are imperative for the functionality of the app, but not necessarily for the project to be passable for the Coding Dojo requirements):

- many-to-many between users and hangout rooms, with one-to-many between users and chat messages
- ability to make friendships
- ability to block users
- search dashboard feed by interest
- allow user to add (searchable) interest without duplication
- video chat functionality
- show past connections in user history
- allow user to specify what kind of hangout: actively cooperative, sharing/seeking expertise in subject matter, silent (users are only here to hold selves accountable and accomplish respective work)
